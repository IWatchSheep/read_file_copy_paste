the program reads a file to find out if the file is empty.

if the file is not empty then the file is copied to the clipboard, then the mouse moves over a text file, then the clipboard is pasted into a second text file and saved.

then the original text file is emptied.

then you can put more text into the original file, save it, then that will automatically be put into the second text file while erasing the text in the second text file.

then to stop this you press the escape key on the keyboard.
