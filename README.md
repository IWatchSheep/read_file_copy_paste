the program reads a file to find out if the file is empty.

if the file is not empty then the file is copied to the clipboard, then the mouse moves over a text file, then the clipboard is pasted into a second text file and saved.

then the original text file is emptied.

then you can put more text into the original file, save it, then that will automatically be put into the second text file while erasing the text in the second text file.

then to stop this you press the escape key on the keyboard.

some idea on polymorphism:

see picture of blue square in middle top, two stacked blue squares bottom left, two stacked pink squares bottom right.
the box with text is below the top middle blue square, in the text box is:
condition
true
false

the top blue box has a arrow pointing down to the word "condition".
the word "true" has an arrow pointing to the top blue box.
the word "false" has an arrow pointing to the top pink box.

blue_1) goes to another color either pink or blue and tests a color equality condition - condition goes to (the color pink1). (the color pink1) goes to (the color pink_2) = 1 color blue, 2 color pink

condition goes to (the color blue2). (the color blue2) goes to (the color blue_3) = 3 color blue, 0 color pink
description: Dynamic cast in C++ polymorphism, The original class is labelled "Parent". Additional classes are labelled "Child" classes. Child classes append the Parent class name to the child class named like this: child class name : parent class name { };

If the parent has a public function not in the child classes, through "dynamic cast" the child classes can inherit the parent function and use the parent function. but the child class having a public function not in the parent class then the parent can't use dynamic cast to inherit the function from the child.

see picture of square in middle top, two stacked squares bottom left, two stacked squares bottom right.
the box with text is below the top middle blue square, in the text box is:
condition
true
false

the top box minus sign has a arrow pointing down to the word "condition".
the word "true" has an arrow pointing to the top left box plus sign.
the word "false" has an arrow pointing to the top right box minus sign.

the top box has the plus and minus signs arranged with the plus on top and the minus on the bottom.
the two stacked bottom boxes on the left also have the plus and minus signs arranged with the plus on top and the minus on the bottom.
the two stacked bottom boxes on the right also have the plus and minus signs arranged with the plus on bottom and the minus on the top.

(the magnet_1 [positive to negative]) goes to condition - condition goes to (the flipped magnet2 [negative to positive]). (the flipped magnet2 [negative to positive]) goes to (the flipped magnet_3 [negative to positive]) = (1 repelled magnet = magnet 1), (2 attracted magnets: flipped magnets 2 and 3)

condition goes to (the magnet2 [positive to negative]). (the magnet2 [positive to negative]) goes to (the magnet3 [positive to negative]) = 0 repelled magnets, (3 attracted magnets: magnet1, magnet2, magnet3)
description: dynamic cast works if the classes have magnetic polarity. the magnets attract if inheritance is true.

description: using fraction multiplication to cancel like terms to simplify the math to get a ratio of 1 to 2.

////////////////////

the ratio (1 to 2) = the ratio (1 to 1) 
if, the divisor 2 being attracted magnets that sum up to 1 magnet.
[(-, +), (-, +)] = (-, +)

{[(-, +), (-, +)] * 2 } = {(-, +) * 2} 
= 
{(-, +), (-, +), (-, +), (-, +)} = {(-, +), (-, +)}

the multiplication product dividend parents are C++ virtual parents, they inherit the original factor dividend,
{(-, +) : virtual (-, +), (-, +) : virtual (-, +)}.
child (multiplication product) class : inherits parent ((multiplication factor) class

meaning (the dividend parents = 2) have opposite magnetic polarity to (the dividend parent = 1). 
the dividend 2 is the opposite polarity to the dividend 1.

meaning the {(-, +) : virtual (-, +), (-, +) : virtual (-, +)} = the child class divisor, so flip the polarity for the child;
{(+, -) : virtual (-, +), (+, -) : virtual (-, +)}.

the divisor of 2 inherits from virtual parents dividend, 
{(-, +) : (-, +) = (+, -), (-, +) : (-, +) = (+, -)}



/////////////////////

Energy = parent class with (Positive Negative) polarity + false condition Mass at rest = child class with (Positive Negative) polarity + true condition Mass at rest = child class with (Negative Positive) polarity + false condition

Energy = parent class with (Negative Positive) polarity + true condition Mass at rest = child class with (Positive Negative) polarity + false condition Mass at rest = child class with (Negative Positive) polarity + true condition

The energy changes when comparing attracting vs repelling magnets.

The mass at rest is the child class 2, the speed/velocity of light is from moving downwards to child class 3, so is child class 3 c? I think so. Child class 3 is using the velocity from child class 2 as a square. c is squared by the speed from child class 2 so child class 2 serves as both mass and c, c for when the third class uses it as another child class 3 for speed/velocity.

And that is how special relativity works into the theory.

/////////////////////

the mass at rest is in the fraction (1/2), because the energy 1, does not add to the velocity/speed of c that is child class 3.
imagine lack of energy in the wave slit experiment is the empty space between the wave marks on the wall.

(I add C++ NOT operator to the text above to show the visible lines in the double slit experiment)
